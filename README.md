Homework #13 UConn Bootcamp

* Burger Monster! is a web app that lets users input the names of burger and feeds it to our server. 

* When the user submits a burger's name they feel like eating, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page in a list format -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The Burger Monster app stores every burger input in the form in a database, whether it is eaten or left out.
